An analysis of the impact of healthcare expenditure on health outcomes in ASEAN countries using panel ARDL

#  The Impacts of Health Expenditures and Economic Growth on Health Outcome: Empirical Evidence from ASEAN Countries

This project explores the relationship between healthcare expenditure and health outcomes across ASEAN countries, using panel ARDL econometric analysis.

## 📌 Objective

To determine whether health spending and GDP affect life expectancy and infant mortality in ASEAN countries.

## 📊 Data

- Source: World Bank
- Countries: ASEAN
- Time frame: [2000-2021]
- Variables:
  - Life Expectancy
  - Infant Mortality Rate
  - Government Health Expenditure
  - Private Health Expenditure
  - Out-of-pocket expenditure
  - GDP per Capita

## ⚙️ Methodology

- Tools used: Excel and EViews
- Econometric model: Panel ARDL (Auto-Regressive Distributed Lag)
- Steps:
  1. Data cleaning and transformation
  2. Stationarity test, cointegration test, cross-sectional dependence test, panel unit root test
  3. Model estimation with Panel ARDL
  4. Interpretation

## 📈 Key Insights

- Economic growth improves life expectancy, but its benefits are not equally shared—higher GDP per capita is unexpectedly linked to higher infant mortality, likely due to healthcare access disparities.
- Public and private health expenditures both enhance life expectancy, but public spending may increase infant mortality in the long run, suggesting inefficiencies or misallocation.
- Out-of-pocket (OOP) spending shows a positive role in improving both life expectancy and reducing infant mortality, highlighting gaps in public healthcare systems.

## 🖼️ Visualizations

Visualizations available in the `charts/` folder:
- Trend: health outcome, government health expenditure, and out-of-pocket
- Comparison: Life expectancy to current health expenditure

## 🧠 Conclusion

Increased healthcare spending is correlated with better health outcomes, but the impact varies by country and timeline. Policymakers should consider structural healthcare factors along with expenditure.
