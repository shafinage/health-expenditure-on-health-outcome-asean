An analysis of the impact of healthcare expenditure on health outcomes in ASEAN countries using panel ARDL

#  The Impacts of Health Expenditures and Economic Growth on Health Outcome: Empirical Evidence from ASEAN Countries

This project explores the relationship between healthcare expenditure and health outcomes across ASEAN countries, using panel ARDL econometric analysis.

## üìå Objective

To determine whether health spending and GDP affect life expectancy and infant mortality in ASEAN countries.

## üìä Data

- Source: World Bank
- Countries: ASEAN
- Time frame: [2000-2021]
- Variables:
  - Life Expectancy
  - Infant Mortality Rate
  - Government Health Expenditure
  - Private Health Expenditure
  - Out-of-pocket expenditure
  - GDP per Capita

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

- Tools used: Excel and EViews
- Econometric model: Panel ARDL (Auto-Regressive Distributed Lag)
- Steps:
  1. Data cleaning and transformation
  2. Stationarity test, cointegration test, cross-sectional dependence test, panel unit root test
  3. Model estimation with Panel ARDL
  4. Interpretation

## üìà Key Insights

- Economic growth improves life expectancy, but its benefits are not equally shared‚Äîhigher GDP per capita is unexpectedly linked to higher infant mortality, likely due to healthcare access disparities.
- Public and private health expenditures both enhance life expectancy, but public spending may increase infant mortality in the long run, suggesting inefficiencies or misallocation.
- Out-of-pocket (OOP) spending shows a positive role in improving both life expectancy and reducing infant mortality, highlighting gaps in public healthcare systems.

## üñºÔ∏è Visualizations

Visualizations and tables available:
- EDA:
  - Trend: health outcome, government health expenditure, and out-of-pocket
  - Comparison: Life expectancy to current health expenditure
- Findings:
  - Stationarity, cointegration, cross-sectional dependence, panel unit root
  - Panel ARDL: ASEAN and per income subgroups
  - Dumitrecu-Hurlin causality

## üß† Conclusion

This study highlights the complex interplay between economic growth, health ex-penditure, and health outcomes in ASEAN countries. Effective health policies that address financing, inefficiencies, and inequities are essential for improving health outcomes and achieving universal health coverage in the region. By prioritizing eq-uitable and sustainable healthcare investments, ASEAN countries can enhance the health and well-being of their populations, contributing to broader economic and social development goals.
